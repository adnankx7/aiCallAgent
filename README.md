# 🤖 AI Intern Project – Chatbot, Calling Bot & WhatsApp Integration

Welcome to the AI internship project!  
The goal is to explore and build a chatbot, AI-powered calling bot, and later integrate it with WhatsApp.

## 📌 Project Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1 – AI Chatbot
- Research and implement a **simple chatbot** using OpenAI API (text-based).
- Create a Node.js/Express or Python Flask backend for handling chat requests.
- Deploy locally and test via REST API (Postman).

### Phase 2 – AI Calling Bot
- Explore **Open AI API** (or alternative like Vonage).
- Implement a bot that:
  - Answers a call
  - Plays an AI-generated greeting
  - Accepts user input (speech-to-text)
  - Responds with AI-generated voice (TTS)
- Maintain logs of each call.

### Phase 3 – WhatsApp Integration
- Explore **Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox** or **Meta WhatsApp Cloud API**.
- Connect the chatbot to WhatsApp:
  - User sends a message → backend → AI → reply back via WhatsApp.
- Ensure simple conversation logging.
